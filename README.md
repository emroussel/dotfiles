# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for macOS.

## Files
### `brew.sh`
Installs brew if not already installed, updates packages, and installs the packages in `Brewfile`.

### `setup.sh`
Symlinks all files and makes a back up of previous ones.

### `macos.sh`
Sets up macOS settings.

### `vscode.sh`
Symlinks vscode settings, and installs extensions.
